# Python Financial Data Analyzer: CSV Processing, Aggregation & Visualization
## Project Overview
This script serves as a robust utility for junior data analysis. It demonstrates core Python skills combined with essential libraries to process raw financial data from a CSV file, calculate key metrics, and generate clear visualizations.

## Key Features:
 **Data Handling:** Utilizes the Pandas library for efficient loading, cleaning, and manipulation of structured CSV data.
 **Filtering & Aggregation:** Automatically filters income entries and groups expenses by category to calculate total spending.
 **Visualization:** Generates a professional bar chart (using Matplotlib) saved as a PNG file, providing a clear visual representation of spending distribution.
 **Statistics:** Calculates key metrics, including total amount spent, largest expense, and smallest expense.

## Technologies Used
 Python 3
 Pandas
 Matplotlib

## How to Run the Script
1. Clone or download the repository files.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed: `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
3. Run the script from your terminal: `python analyzer.py`.
